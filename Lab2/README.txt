What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objectives of this lab were to learn how
to use full adders and registers to add and hold data. 
Also, to learn how to use a full adder to convert binary into 2s complement.
What was your design approach?
My design approach was to first create a 4 bit adder, then design a system to hold 
the data. Then I designed a multiplexer to decide when a signal is allowed to travel
to the 4-bit adder and the value stored in the register. Then I took the values from
the register and converted it into 2s complement with a 3 bit adder. I then created 
a multiplexer to decide when to allow the 2s complement to go through. The multiplexer 
select would be the MSB in the register.
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
My biggest issue was numbering my signal senders incorrectly. So my display was either 
reversed or completely wrong because the binary number being sent was in the wrong order.
 I also had lots of trouble finding out where to start so it was very frustrating until I went
to lab or someone that could help me. Finding out my system works was very enjoyable. The best 
part of doing these circuits is finishing and finding out that the entire system works flawlessly
minus the extra credit.
How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
I would replace the webcast that was taken down. The main part of the lab required the knowledge of the full
adder and the webcast would've been very helpful in review and relearning the logic gates for the system. 
I would also be a little more specific in the diagram about the display logic. I was unsure if it was Mux into adder
or adder into mux until I went to extra office hours.
