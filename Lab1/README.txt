What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to use truth tables and Sum of Products to recieve the correct outputs.
What worked well?
The notes and lecture really helped me hone in on the gates and a way to replace gates with one type of gate.
Did you encounter any issues?
It was difficult to get started on the circuits, but when I understood how to execute what I was thinking it was easy from there on out.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think examples of similar, but different circuits would help kickstart an idea on how to complete the logic gates.
