The text of your prompts are stored in the processor’s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
There are three addresses, each 8 values long. 

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objectives of this lab were to learn the basics of MIPS instruction set
and learn basic loops.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
The mars program would crash if there was an infinite loop present. If the number of legs or triangles were too large
the program would crash. The lab was enjoyable once I understood what I needed to do to get it to work.
It was fun being able to program the lab when I knew the functions required to complete the lab.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would make the videos and reading an assignment to make knowing the functions alot easier and a requirement.
I would add something about pseudocode in the lab manual to help people find their way. I might have wanted a hint
about pattern recognition in the lab manual or something.


Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? 
Please list who you collaborated
with and the nature of your collaboration.

He helped me produce my own pseudocode and answer questions about how the functions work and 
how the code should be layed out inorder to recieve full credit. He never showed me any of his code, he basically
helped me produce my own code through a white board and his ability to teach.
