-------------------------
What was your design approach?
In the order, I completed the give_prompt area, then I started on the cipher,
branching into the check_sum, into encrypt/decrypt, from there I started on
check_ascii, sending the encrypt/decrypt back to cipher, encrypting and decrypting
character by character, and after I have it sent to print_string
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to work the subroutines in MIPS. I learned that everytime I jump and link,
I have to save the address it came from and then clear it when I go back to it.
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I had many bugs and I had to bug hunt and find what made the lab not work. The
lab was enjoyable when I found out it all works.
A big issue I had was that Mars would glitch out when go through the processes 
one by one. It would jump 2 processes when hit enter on the user input.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
This lab is pretty good as is. There isn't much I would change. The cipher part was kind 
of boring and tedious.
Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated
with and the nature of your collaboration.
I did not collaborate with anyone.
